## Description

Notesy is going to be a lightweight command line interface for keeping simple notes.
Making it for Windows at the moment, writing in C++.
Eventually it'd be neat to offer some sort of synchronization.
Also thinking about versioning the notes and allowing some sort of rollbacks.
Search features are another possibility, but for now it's going to be fairly straightforward.

## TODO
* classes
* commands
* decide on serialization strategy
* command table (think shell) with names, function pointers
* initialization strategy
* some sort of config file format, notesy directory, console color
